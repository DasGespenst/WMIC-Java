# WMIC-Java
Can execute WMIC and command line args. In need of a proper GUI &amp; working commands requiring admin priveleges.
Consists of a main method with overridden methods from 3 different interfaces, one for WMIC commands, one for regular cmd commands and another for cmd commands requiring admin priveleges. The GUI isn't ready at all but the idea is to be able to 
execute WMIC commands and admin commands with ease. A lot of useful information from a computer can
be gleaned with WMIC so I thought it'd be interesting to see if java could perform these commands.
